This mod adds one new rule: If you hold all hills at the end of a turn, you win. The number and size of hills can be altered.
The hills are indicated with Money Caches and can found by clicking 'Game' on the bottom left and then 'Mod: King Of The Hill'. 
In team games, the game ends when a team holds all hills.
